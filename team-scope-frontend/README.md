‚ö†Ô∏è Special Note
Due to time constraints, we were unable to integrate a database in this version of the application. As a result, the backend currently uses mock data stored in memory, which limits the functionality of features like adding and deleting records.

We truly appreciate your understanding, and if granted an additional day, we would be happy to implement a full database solution. This will enable persistent data storage and allow dynamic operations such as adding, and deleting employees to function as expected.

We are fully committed to delivering a complete and scalable solution and would love the opportunity to enhance this further.
